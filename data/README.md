1.	Cancer relapsed within 5 years

We have collected gene expression levels for 4654 genes on 184 early-stage breast cancer samples: xtrain.txt (each row is a gene, each column a sample). After surgical removal of the tumour, some unfortunately relapsed within 5 years (label=+1), while other did not (label=-1). The labels of the the 184 samples are available in the file ytrain.txt.
